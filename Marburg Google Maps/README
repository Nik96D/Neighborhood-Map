This is my Neighborhood Map Udacity Project.
It shows various places of my Hometown with a marker that when it is clicked opens a infowindow with a googlestreetview image and a link to a wikipedia page at the sidebar. On the sidebar you can also find all the locations in a list and search through them with the searchbar. The list items can also open the marker infowindow.


How to run the apllication:

Open the knockout.html file in your browser.
